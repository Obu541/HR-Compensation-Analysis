# 📊 Pay Equity & Compensation Analysis  
**Tools Used:** Tableau · Python · SQL

This project explores gender-based pay equity and compensation trends across departments and job levels using a mock HR dataset. I developed three independent solutions using Tableau, Python, and SQL to analyze salary distribution, representation, and potential pay gaps.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The analysis identifies:
- How average salary varies by gender and job level
- Where salary gaps may exist
- Gender representation across job levels
- Distribution patterns and outliers

The multi-tool approach demonstrates versatility in handling HR analytics with different technologies.
